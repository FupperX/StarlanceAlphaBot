You see there is a problem with the allowance for people to modify the kind of things a bot could say. Sometimes it could be derogatory, funny, or very lengthy like this paragraph here. What would it be like now that people have the power to express themselves? Chaos? Anarchy? Opportunity perhaps? Opportunity to what? To meme? Reject modernity, embrace tradition.
