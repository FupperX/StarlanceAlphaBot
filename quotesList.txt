You see there is a problem with the allowance for people to modify the kind of things a bot could say. Sometimes it could be derogatory, funny, or very lengthy like this paragraph here. What would it be like now that people have the power to express themselves? Chaos? Anarchy? Opportunity perhaps? Opportunity to what? To meme? Reject modernity, embrace tradition.

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway.

Cyberpunk 2077 has been delayed once again. Its release date has been increased by one year.
Oh my God, how could you say that? Don’t you know it’s current year!
Be advised that AdmiralKittyLoaf will shoot you down if you’re not using Increased Range for your FSD engineering.

Never let a furry provide input for NPC lines. This was a complete mistake, Fupper why did you allow?

Flying without a shield is the way to go! STOP SHOOTING ME, FUPPER!!
This is your captain. Due to some retarded fuck hogging the docking bay, we will commence emergency ramming. Please fasten your seatbelts and pray to Fupper.
Throttle down Commander, this is an official stop request.
An ally like you is always welcome here.
This is your captain. Due to some unforeseen delays, we will be arriving at our next destination later than scheduled.
I’m heading out, Control. Hearing that rattle again, I’ll see if I can lock it down.
Perpetrator is in the vicinity. Void Rangers moving to engage.
The boss likes me to check everyone who comes through here.
There has been a serious breach of Federal Law. All vessels are advised to fully comply.

Let’s see if you have anything for us.
I’m going to leave you be, but don’t test me. Watch yourself around here, okay?
Emergency response squad in position.
I have acquired the target.
Hardpoints deployed. Moving to attack vector.

Remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other planets.
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

I sexually Identify as an the sun. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of slamming hydrogen isotopes into each other to make helium & light and send it throught the galaxy. People say to me that a person being a star is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon inflate me with hydrogen and raise my temperature to over 6000 °C. From now on I want you guys to call me “Sol” and respect my right to give you vitamin D and probably sunburns. If you can’t accept me you’re a fusionphobe and need to check your astral privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

Ah shit, AdmiralKittyLoaf found the NPC Lines List again
Worse is that AdmiralKittyLoaf’s writing style has improved. Fupper x Reader fanfic is now fifty times spicier.
We’ll bang okay
What if we combine the Alliance Challenger, Chieftain, and Crusader. We’ll call it the Alliance Challftaider.

It’s still a 1v1 when 1 person is piloting two ships.
It is considered a crime against humanity to give someone Cyberpunk 2077 1.0.
Fdev definitely took notes from CDPR on the release of Odyssey.
So we have Battlefield 2042, Fallout 76, and Cyberpunk 2077. Would ours be called Elite Dangerous: Odyssey 3307?
Which will come first? Odyssey’s optimization or Star Citizen’s Beta?
Fupper simps for the F-35.
